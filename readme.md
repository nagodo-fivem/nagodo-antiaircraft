# Nagodo Anti Aircraft System
This script allow servers to create restricted airspace where certain jobs or vehicle models are allowed to fly while others are automatically shot down. This script provides enhanced control over aerial activities within your FiveM server, ensuring security and maintaining gameplay balance.

## Features
- No Fly Zone Creation: Administrators can easily define specific areas on the map as no fly zones, restricting unauthorized aerial access in the config.
- Job and Vehicle Restrictions: Configure the script to allow or disallow certain jobs or vehicle models from flying within the designated no fly zones.
- Automatic Response: If an unauthorized job or vehicle attempts to enter the restricted airspace, the script will automatically initiate a response to shoot it down.
- Customizable Settings: Customize various parameters such as no fly zone locations, allowed jobs, disallowed vehicle models and accuracy of the missile.

## Configuration
This script offers a range of configuration options that allow to customize its behavior.
- No Fly Zones: You can add as many no fly zones as you want in the configuration file. This allows you to define which areas on the map are restricted.
- Allowed Jobs: You can define which jobs are allowed to fly within the restricted airspace. If a job is not listed in the configuration file, it will be automatically disallowed.
- Allowed Vehicles: You can define which vehicle models are allowed from flying within the restricted airspace. If a vehicle model is not listed in the configuration file, it will be automatically disallowed.
- Missile Accuracy: You can adjust the accuracy of the missile to suit your server's needs. The higher the accuracy, the more likely it is to hit the target.
